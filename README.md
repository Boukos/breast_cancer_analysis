# breast-cancer-analysis
Final Project for ECON 1660

Authors - Andrew Dabydeen and Ryan Hedges

Please find our project in the CancerAnalysis.ipynb jupyter notebook which is meant to be interactive. You will find that the code matches the analysis explained in our Medium article which gave a link to this GitHub repo. Along with the notebook, you will find two .npy files which has our image data and labels to go along with the code. Thank you!
